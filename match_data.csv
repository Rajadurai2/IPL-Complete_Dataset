They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.  When: May 9, 2018, 8 pm IST  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: Showers are forecast in the afternoon, but should clear out ahead of the game. The pitch again is expected provide good pace and bounce, something the batsmen will enjoy.  Head to Head: MI have enjoyed an incredible run against KKR, winning 17, while the hosts have managed just five wins. At the Eden Gardens, MI have a better record with six wins over the home team in eight games.  Team news:  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi picked up a finger injury in the clash against CSK and was forced to sit out of the game in Mumbai. On the eve of the clash, he spent most of his time on the sidelines, not warming up or bowling, and given the quick turnaround time, it's highly unlikely he'll be fit for this clash as well.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c, wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Mitchell Johnson, Prasidh Krishna, Piyush Chawla, Kuldeep Yadav  Mumbai Indians: MI walk into the clash with all bases covered. They've got pacers to exploit the pace and bounce from the pitch and in-form spinners as well. They are unlikely to make a change to their winning combination.

We are going to get one back tomorrow night. We definitely owe them one. The boys are desperate because if we don't win, we are going to put ourselves under a lot of pressure in the last three games"" - Chris Lynn on KKR's poor record against MI.  ""What's been great about our team is that we stood up. We took responsibility and realised that we are the ones who are going to change our fortunes around.

They've got pacers to exploit the pace and bounce from the pitch and in-form spinners as well. They are unlikely to make a change to their winning combination.  B7$ Suryakumar Yadav, Evin Lewis, Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, JP Duminy, Ben Cutting, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mayank Markande, Jasprit Bumrah  Interesting face-offs:  Rohit vs KKR: 22 inngs; 721 runs; Avg 45.06; SR 136.55; 1 x 100s; 4 x 50s; HS 109*  Rohit at Eden: 11 inngs; 418 runs; Avg 52.25; SR 146.67; 1 x 100s; 3 x 50; HS 109*  Narine vs Rohit in all T20s: 94 balls; 93 runs; seven dismissals; SR 98.94  Approaching milestones:  Sunil Narine has 46 wickets at the Eden Gardens in IPL games and needs four more wickets to become the second bowler after Lasith Malinga (at Wankhede) to take 50 wickets in a venue.  What they said:  ""There's a bit of jinx going on. Our win-loss record isn't great against them. Someone like Mahela and Rohit have done a good job with them. We are going to get one back tomorrow night. We definitely owe them one. The boys are desperate because if we don't win, we are going to put ourselves under a lot of pressure in the last three games"" - Chris Lynn on KKR's poor record against MI.  ""What's been great about our team is that we stood up. We took responsibility and realised that we are the ones who are going to change our fortunes around. The manner in which we've played our cricket in the last few games has epitomised the brand of cricket we want to play"" - JP Duminy on MI's revival after a slow start.",KKR,field,Mumbai Indians won by 102 runs,Ishan Kishan

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.  When: IPL 2018 final - May 27, Sunday, 7 PM IST  Where: Wankhede, Mumbai  What to expect: The last match at the Wankhede was a spinner's delight, and the likes of Ravindra Jadeja and Rashid Khan feasted on it. Expect more of the same on Sunday. Weatherwise, a cloudy, humid evening with a slight chance of rain.  Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Expect Dhoni's side not to go in with any changes. Harbhajan could be given a bigger role, he did not bowl at all in the last game, given how the pitch will behave. Karn Sharma has an outside chance, should CSK look at beefing their spin department.  Predicted Playing XI: Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & wk), Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Lungi Ngidi  Sunrisers Hyderabad: SRH may have put an end to their four-game losing streak by beating KKR, but they are still bogged down by a few issues. Thier biggest buy in the auction, Manish Pandey, could come back in for their biggest game of the season given Hooda's lack of form, while Khaleel Ahmed not-so-inspiring outing in the last game could bring Sandeep Sharma back into the spotlight.  B6$ Shikhar Dhawan, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Kane Williamson (c), Manish Pandey/Deepak Hooda, Yusuf Pathan, Shakib al Hasan, Carlos Brathwaite, Rashid Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Siddharth Kaul, Khaleel Ahmed/Sandeep Sharma.  What they said:  ""Look I think we can all recall the last game we played. We could have won that game by 20 runs or lost it as we did. It was a remarkable comeback from CSK. I guess we got 90 percent of that game right and you got to give credit where it’s due. Faf played a remarkable innings and showed his class and experience to be able to see it right to the end. You know, I’m not looking at areas that we need to tighten up. We just need to concentrate on our brand of cricket and make sure we bring that to the final tomorrow. And as long as we do that, I’m sure we’ll be competitive on the day."" - Tom Moody, SRH Head Coach  ""Experience really counts but it’s not that it always matters. It is not something that can’t be replaced. Excess of everything is bad... the good thing is we have managed with them very well, we have got quite a few good fielders in the side... It is good that whenever we have played we have had at least two good fielders or outstanding fielders, that can man that deep midwicket position.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.  When: IPL 2018 final - May 27, Sunday, 7 PM IST  Where: Wankhede, Mumbai  What to expect: The last match at the Wankhede was a spinner's delight, and the likes of Ravindra Jadeja and Rashid Khan feasted on it. Expect more of the same on Sunday. Weatherwise, a cloudy, humid evening with a slight chance of rain.  Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Expect Dhoni's side not to go in with any changes. Harbhajan could be given a bigger role, he did not bowl at all in the last game, given how the pitch will behave. Karn Sharma has an outside chance, should CSK look at beefing their spin department.  Predicted Playing XI: Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & wk), Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Lungi Ngidi  Sunrisers Hyderabad: SRH may have put an end to their four-game losing streak by beating KKR, but they are still bogged down by a few issues. Thier biggest buy in the auction, Manish Pandey, could come back in for their biggest game of the season given Hooda's lack of form, while Khaleel Ahmed not-so-inspiring outing in the last game could bring Sandeep Sharma back into the spotlight.  B6$ Shikhar Dhawan, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Kane Williamson (c), Manish Pandey/Deepak Hooda, Yusuf Pathan, Shakib al Hasan, Carlos Brathwaite, Rashid Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Siddharth Kaul, Khaleel Ahmed/Sandeep Sharma.  What they said:  ""Look I think we can all recall the last game we played. We could have won that game by 20 runs or lost it as we did. It was a remarkable comeback from CSK. I guess we got 90 percent of that game right and you got to give credit where it’s due. Faf played a remarkable innings and showed his class and experience to be able to see it right to the end. You know, I’m not looking at areas that we need to tighten up. We just need to concentrate on our brand of cricket and make sure we bring that to the final tomorrow. And as long as we do that, I’m sure we’ll be competitive on the day."" - Tom Moody, SRH Head Coach  ""Experience really counts but it’s not that it always matters. It is not something that can’t be replaced. Excess of everything is bad... the good thing is we have managed with them very well, we have got quite a few good fielders in the side... It is good that whenever we have played we have had at least two good fielders or outstanding fielders, that can man that deep midwicket position. We have done well so far but it is something that can hurt us at any time."" - MS Dhoni, CSK Captain  Stats:  Head to Head of teams  SRH 2 - 7 CSK  Team Record in Playoffs  SRH 4 W - 3 L  CSK 11 W - 7 L  Interesting face-offs  Rayudu vs SRH: Ten inngs; 385 runs; Avg 48.13; SR 144.19  Against no other side against whom he has batted more than one innings, he has a better average or SR.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.  When: Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings, April 3, 20:00 IST  Where: Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: A slug fest on a batting beauty. It's not a kind of game the Super Kings have played so far this season and thus will be eager to test their batting prowess. On such a pitch, spinners could be momentarily forced to contemplate their choice of a vocation, and the team batting first will constantly recalibrate a par score to account for the dew allowance.  Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at. Mitchell McClenaghan, a reliable operator for the franchise in the past, hasn't had the best of starts so far and could make way for Australian quick Jason Behrendorff, who has joined the squad after his national team commitments.

201916,IPL,2019,16th,"Apr 04,2019","Arun Jaitley Stadium,Delhi",Delhi Capitals,Sunrisers Hyderabad,"Delhi Capitals (Playing XI): Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Shreyas Iyer(c), Rishabh Pant(w), Colin Ingram, Chris Morris, Axar Patel, Rahul Tewatia, Kagiso Rabada, Sandeep Lamichhane, Ishant Sharma","Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Jonny Bairstow(w), David Warner, Vijay Shankar, Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan, Deepak Hooda, Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar(c), Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul","Preview by Pratyush Sinha  A total of four questions were posed to Shreyas Iyer at the post-match presser in Mohali, three out of them being about the biggest collapse in the history of IPL. If Iyer really had the answers, Delhi Capitals would now be sitting at the top of the table with four out of four wins. They don't, and ""right now have broken hearts,"" according to Mohammad Kaif.  Delhi's bouncebackability from a rut of similar collapses, when they have thawed at the sight of easy targets closing on, will be the main center of interest in their game against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, a team so well covered and in such good form that Kane Williamson's absence against RCB probably didn't even matter.  What piques interest though is the pitch SRH will be playing on. The track at Feroz Shah Kotla will be like anything but Hyderabad, which has come a long way from being the forcing house for two legspinners and delivered consecutive 200-plus totals this season. Kotla, in contrast, will be low and slow with variable bounce, giving batsmen little to hit through the line. How SRH, with an Australian and an Englishman at the top, adjust could determine the game.  When: Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, 16th Match at 8:00 PM IST  Where: Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi  What to expect: 24 hours before the game, the pitch bore the usual barren look though previous IPL games have seen pitches with more grass. Whether it's a tactic to drive SRH out of their comfort zone is anyone's guess.  It's going to be a warm evening, with temperatures set to be around 34 degrees at the start of the match. The expected dew should make batting easier in the second innings.  Team news:  Delhi Capitals  There's a genuine case for swapping the batting positions of Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who currently bat at No 4 and 3 respectively. There have been three collapses in three games, and each has been triggered by Pant's wicket, with Iyer falling before him everytime. The option to have the team's captain come after Pant's done his bit with the bat isn't a bad idea.  Amit Mishra could come back in for Avesh Khan, to whom he had lost his spot on a flatter Mohali pitch. Axar Patel might replace Harshal Patel to give that middle-order a lift.  Probable XI: Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Colin Ingram, Hanuma Vihari, Chris Morris, Harshal Patel/Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada/Trent Boult, Amit Mishra/Avesh Khan  Sunrisers Hyderabad  David Warner was bruised on his finger while taking Virat Kohli's catch in the last game and was off the field, but Tom Moody has confirmed that Warner is fit to play. Kane Williamson could return to lead the side.  B6$ David Warner, Jonny Bairstow(w), Vijay Shankar, Kane Williamson/Deepak Hooda, Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan, Rashid Khan, Shahbaz Nadeem/Mohammad Nabi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul  Did you know  - At Feroz Shah Kotla, SRH have a 3-1 win ratio over DC  - In IPL, Bhuvi's numbers against Delhi are his poorest against an opponent. He's picked five wickets in 13 games at an average 74.2 and economy-rate of 7.73  - SRH are yet to lose a wicket in the first six overs in IPL 2019.  What they said  ""Teams are planning in advance so that their quick fielders stay on the field longer and the slower fielders don't. The umpires should see that the fielding changes (substitutions) don't waste a lot of time"" - Mohammad Kaif , DC assistant coach  There are adjustments you need to do in Delhi in order to be effective, so our focus is very much around that. What Delhi have done in the last game is not going to have any bearing on our preparation. - Tom Moody , SRH head coach","Preview by Pratyush Sinha  A total of four questions were posed to Shreyas Iyer at the post-match presser in Mohali, three out of them being about the biggest collapse in the history of IPL.

Delhi's bouncebackability from a rut of similar collapses, when they have thawed at the sight of easy targets closing on, will be the main center of interest in their game against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, a team so well covered and in such good form that Kane Williamson's absence against RCB probably didn't even matter.  What piques interest though is the pitch SRH will be playing on. The track at Feroz Shah Kotla will be like anything but Hyderabad, which has come a long way from being the forcing house for two legspinners and delivered consecutive 200-plus totals this season. Kotla, in contrast, will be low and slow with variable bounce, giving batsmen little to hit through the line. How SRH, with an Australian and an Englishman at the top, adjust could determine the game.  When: Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, 16th Match at 8:00 PM IST  Where: Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi  What to expect: 24 hours before the game, the pitch bore the usual barren look though previous IPL games have seen pitches with more grass. Whether it's a tactic to drive SRH out of their comfort zone is anyone's guess.  It's going to be a warm evening, with temperatures set to be around 34 degrees at the start of the match. The expected dew should make batting easier in the second innings.  Team news:  Delhi Capitals  There's a genuine case for swapping the batting positions of Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who currently bat at No 4 and 3 respectively. There have been three collapses in three games, and each has been triggered by Pant's wicket, with Iyer falling before him everytime. The option to have the team's captain come after Pant's done his bit with the bat isn't a bad idea.  Amit Mishra could come back in for Avesh Khan, to whom he had lost his spot on a flatter Mohali pitch. Axar Patel might replace Harshal Patel to give that middle-order a lift.  Probable XI: Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Colin Ingram, Hanuma Vihari, Chris Morris, Harshal Patel/Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada/Trent Boult, Amit Mishra/Avesh Khan  Sunrisers Hyderabad  David Warner was bruised on his finger while taking Virat Kohli's catch in the last game and was off the field, but Tom Moody has confirmed that Warner is fit to play. Kane Williamson could return to lead the side.  B6$ David Warner, Jonny Bairstow(w), Vijay Shankar, Kane Williamson/Deepak Hooda, Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan, Rashid Khan, Shahbaz Nadeem/Mohammad Nabi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul  Did you know  - At Feroz Shah Kotla, SRH have a 3-1 win ratio over DC  - In IPL, Bhuvi's numbers against Delhi are his poorest against an opponent. He's picked five wickets in 13 games at an average 74.2 and economy-rate of 7.73  - SRH are yet to lose a wicket in the first six overs in IPL 2019.  What they said  ""Teams are planning in advance so that their quick fielders stay on the field longer and the slower fielders don't. The umpires should see that the fielding changes (substitutions) don't waste a lot of time"" - Mohammad Kaif , DC assistant coach  There are adjustments you need to do in Delhi in order to be effective, so our focus is very much around that. What Delhi have done in the last game is not going to have any bearing on our preparation. - Tom Moody , SRH head coach",SRH,field,Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 5 wkts,Jonny Bairstow

The two three-time champions don't just have the chance to take one more step towards an unprecedented fourth IPL title, but also, in the process, have the opportunity to lay an inconvenient diversion and the risk of elimination for the other. In a two-horse race for the trophy cabinet domination, there can be no better match-up for such a fixture.  And then the plot thickens further. The overall head-to-head (11-15 in favour MI) puts the two sides on a more-or-less even keel. But a closer look reveals Mumbai Indians' recent grip over CSK. MI have lost just once in their last seven meetings against them, and just a fortnight ago, became the first side to beat MS Dhoni's men at Chepauk since... themselves in 2015. CSK could argue that they aren't the similarly in-rhythm orchestra without their master arranger - MS Dhoni - who skipped that match, but the fact remains that MI have had the wood over the title holders for a few seasons now. There's an intriguing back-and-forth in terms of results in knockouts too - CSK lead 4-3 but two of those three wins for MI earned them the trophy.  For Mumbai Indians to level that figure, they have a worrying middle-overs trend to reverse. And that's easier said than done, considering the fulcrum of CSK's success this year has been in the way they've controlled matches in the same phase with the ball [picking 36 wickets and conceding runs at an economy rate of 6.65].  Suryakumar Yadav - MI's No.3 this season - has scored a series of promising 20s, but has failed to consolidate further. MI have also had uncertainty at No.4, leaving Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard to do a sweep up job at the death. Hardik's potency this season has saved MI in many-a-fixture, but Mumbai could do with a better batting foundation from the top-order in such a crucial game.  When: Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians, Qualifier 1, May 7 2019, 7:30 PM IST  Where: M A Chidambaram stadium, Chennai  What to expect: The usual - temperatures soaring past 35 degrees celsius late evening and a pitch playing to perfection for spinners.  Team news  Chennai Super Kings  A shoulder injury in Sunday's game against KXIP ended Kedar Jadhav's IPL 2019, and opened up a middle-order vacancy, expected to be filled by Dhruv Shorey. Shorey has filled in for the regulars this season, but predominantly as a substitute fielder. Incidentally, the one fixture he played in, was against Mumbai Indians at Chepauk, as a replacement for an unwell MS Dhoni. With Jadhav not being used as a bowling option all season, CSK can turn to a specialist batsman in Shorey to plug the gap.  CSK might also have a Mitchell Santner dilemma. The New Zealand spinner was one of the few positives from the league stage game against MI at this venue, picking up 2 wickets for 13 runs in his four overs. But deciding on who could make way for Santner will be tricky.  Shane Watson has had three single-digit outings since his 96 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but replacing him when the team itself is in the midst of ordinary batting performances will be quite a gamble. If they go through with it, they will have to rely on Ambati Rayudu to wiggle his way out of a rut, while also taking up the responsibility of opening the batting.  Probable XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Dhruv Shorey, MS Dhoni, Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Deepak Chahar, Imran Tahir  Mumbai Indians  Mitchell McClenaghan impressed at the Wankhede Stadium in his comeback game, but as the action shifts to a sticky, slow Chepauk strip, the New Zealander might have to make way for a spin option - like leggie Mayank Markande (if fit) or left-arm spinner Anukul Roy.  Such a swap would also give Mumbai Indians the luxury to play an additional overseas player - which means they can pick between Ishan Kishan and Evin Lewis to bat at the troubled No.4 position. There's been very little to choose between the two, as neither has managed to make use of the few chances afforded to them.

Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.  Probable XI: Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal/Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jimmy Neesham, Navdeep Saini, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra Chahal  Gujarat Titans  B7$ Rashid Khan will have a big role to play in containing the dangerous Jos Buttler and later in the order, Shimron Hetmyer - both of who have been among the runs this season. Rashid has a good record against the two dismissing them four times, especially with Buttler averaging just 4.50 against the legspinner.  Probable XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz/Matthew Wade (wk), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (c), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Abhinav Manohar, Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami, Darshan Nalkande  Did you know?  - There was seven first innings totals in excess of 170 in the first 11 matches and just two in the ten subsequent matches, both in Brabourne.  - Only Bumrah has taken more wickets than the duo of Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal in the last half-a-decade in the IPL. And in the middle overs, the two spinners sit on top of the wicket charts.  - Hetmyer has the second-highest strike-rate in death overs since IPL 2019 behind AB de Villiers. He strikes at 195.95 with a boundary percentage of 27.3.  What they said:  ""The toss is not in our control. We are learning to adapt our game keeping the dew factor in mind.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16. Rajasthan Royals held back an over from Yuzvendra Chahal while Delhi Capitals did the same with Kuldeep Yadav, whose final over was kept until the 20th. LSG could do the same with Ravi Bishnoi.  Probable XI:  KL Rahul (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Manish Pandey, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Jason Holder, Dushmantha Chameera, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi  Royal Challengers Bangalore   B7$LSG have been the best team in terms of using spin in the middle overs. They have bowled as many as 37 overs of spin in this stage, more than any other team, have the best economy rate (6.08) among all teams while they have also picked the most wickets (10) using spin in the middle overs. However, RCB have Maxwell, who has scored 62 runs off 28 deliveries in his three matches so far and could be the key for the side to negate LSG's spin threat.  B8$Faf du Plessis (c), Anuj Rawat, Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell, Shahbaz Ahmed, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Suyash Prabhudessai, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammed Siraj  Did you know?   - KL Rahul, who has scored 501 runs against RCB, averages 83.50 against them. This is the highest average for a player against an opponent in the IPL (Min. 400 runs). Jos Buttler's average of 80 against MI is the next best.  - Between them, Rahul and Quinton de Kock have scored 863 runs against RCB, with one hundred and two fifties apiece.  - Harshal Patel, who has bowled nine overs at the death, is yet to pick up a wicket at this stage. He picked up 21 wickets at the death in the previous season.  What they said:   ""I have a bigger goal. I have been working really, really hard. Sometimes people don't believe it, but my aim is to do something special for the country. And this is part of that journey and I'm doing everything I can to be part of that Indian team and this is one such step in that direction"" - Dinesh Karthik at the post-match presentation after his match-winning effort against DC.","Preview by Gokul Gopal:   The overview  Just two days back, Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bangalore became the second and third teams respectively to get to eight points on the standings.

Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16. Rajasthan Royals held back an over from Yuzvendra Chahal while Delhi Capitals did the same with Kuldeep Yadav, whose final over was kept until the 20th. LSG could do the same with Ravi Bishnoi.  Probable XI:  KL Rahul (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Manish Pandey, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Jason Holder, Dushmantha Chameera, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi  Royal Challengers Bangalore   B7$LSG have been the best team in terms of using spin in the middle overs. They have bowled as many as 37 overs of spin in this stage, more than any other team, have the best economy rate (6.08) among all teams while they have also picked the most wickets (10) using spin in the middle overs. However, RCB have Maxwell, who has scored 62 runs off 28 deliveries in his three matches so far and could be the key for the side to negate LSG's spin threat.  B8$Faf du Plessis (c), Anuj Rawat, Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell, Shahbaz Ahmed, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Suyash Prabhudessai, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammed Siraj  Did you know?   - KL Rahul, who has scored 501 runs against RCB, averages 83.50 against them. This is the highest average for a player against an opponent in the IPL (Min. 400 runs). Jos Buttler's average of 80 against MI is the next best.  - Between them, Rahul and Quinton de Kock have scored 863 runs against RCB, with one hundred and two fifties apiece.  - Harshal Patel, who has bowled nine overs at the death, is yet to pick up a wicket at this stage. He picked up 21 wickets at the death in the previous season.  What they said:   ""I have a bigger goal. I have been working really, really hard. Sometimes people don't believe it, but my aim is to do something special for the country. And this is part of that journey and I'm doing everything I can to be part of that Indian team and this is one such step in that direction"" - Dinesh Karthik at the post-match presentation after his match-winning effort against DC.",LSG,field,Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 18 runs,Faf du Plessis

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.  What they said:  ""He (Kohli) is seeing the lighter side of it, every single way that you can possibly get out, is happening to him. That's how the game works. All you can do is to keep trying hard, work hard and stay positive,"" Du Plessis said in the post-match presentation.","Preview by Bharath Ramaraj  The Overview:  It is said that cricket is a game of inches. For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season.

Mohsin also straightaway troubled Patidar by beating him on the edge. In the very next over, Patidar stood tall and punched one past point off Dushmantha Chameera. From there on, Rajat didn't look back. Almost every single time he cracked a shot, there was unbridled celebration among the fans. Patidar remained unbeaten 112 to lay the platform while Harshal Patel held his nerve in the slog overs to power RCB to a defining win in the Eliminator.  Perhaps RCB can now dream of winning some silverware? They certainly have some momentum going into the Qualifier 2 against Rajasthan Royals. They also seem to have a bit of rub of the green going their way this time around. If Rishabh Pant had taken the crucial review against Mumbai Indians, they could have ended another season short of playoffs. In the Eliminator, LSG fielders offered them repreives on the field. More importantly, slowly but steadily, RCB have found the right screws to nail down different departments with the right combinations.  The top order comprising du Plessis, Kohli and Patidar is functioning quite smoothly. Incidentally, this season, the three times Patidar has come out to bat after an RCB opener has been dismissed for no score, he has gone on to make a contribution of substance. Dinesh Karthik and to an extent Glenn Maxwell have chipped in with their share of significant contributions. RCB's lower-middle-order also seems to have a bit of a buffer. At Eden Gardens, Harshal showed smarts by bowling into the pitch twinned with slower ones while Hazlewood cracked the code of landing the yorkers. Despite having a bit of quiet time in the Eliminator, Wanindu Hasaranga is the figurehead, especially in the middle phase of the innings.  Rajasthan Royals too would be dreaming of ending their long drought which extends back to the first IPL season when they hoisted the trophy. RR ended up on the losing side in a hard-fought contest against Gujarat Titans but they have another chance to progress to the summit clash. Jos Buttler would be once again a key figure in the RR camp. The RR talisman hasn't just aggregated the most runs this season but has also cracked 39 sixes. Sanju Samson has been an able ally while Shimron Hetmyer has been the main disruptor of bowling attacks in the slog overs, even as he has found runs hard to come by in the second half of the IPL (77 runs in his last six innings).  Meanwhile, the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravichandran Ashwin couldn't pick a single wicket versus GT. RR's spinners have bagged three or more wickets in an innings on eight occasions in IPL 2022, and the franchise has won all those matches. Prasidh Krishna provides the side with hit the deck option while Trent Boult gives them the left-arm angle. But Prasidh would do well to find an erase button and move on from his forgettable last over to David Miller.  When: Friday, May 27 at 7:30 PM IST  Where: Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad  What to expect: The distance between Kolkata and Ahmedabad is 1617 km by air. So the overall conditions are also different. It is more about dry heat than humidity in Ahmedabad. Even though the temperature is expected to drop down to 29 degree Celsius in the night. The ground has six red soil pitches and five black soil pitches. So the nature of the pitch could come down to the characteristics of the soil. On occasions, the curator has left a covering of grass for a T20 game. For an important match, the curator could end up preparing a pitch with more of even bounce.  Head to head: In total, the two teams have met 26 times, with RR winning 11 and RCB emerging victorious in 13. Since 2018, RR have come out on top in four matches while RCB have won five.  Team Watch  Rajasthan Royals:  Tactics and matchups: Du Plessis has been dismissed six times by left-arm pacemen in this IPL. In the Powerplay, it is the delivery that moves across him (or straightens) that has accounted for his wicket on all four occasions. Even in the Eliminator game, his front foot got opened up with the left elbow pointing more towards mid-on as he edged one behind. Boult, who has snared du Plessis's wicket three times in T20s, would be visualising such a dismissal.  Three of RCB's big four - Kohli, Du Plessis and Karthik - strike at under 100 versus Chahal. Maxwell has found some success against Chahal by scoring 120 runs off 70 balls but he has also been dislodged five times by the leg-spinner. The leg-spinner has also taken 14 wickets in the end overs this season.
